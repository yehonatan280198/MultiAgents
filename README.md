# Robust Multiagent Combinatorial Path Finding

This repository implements the core algorithms and methods described in the paper "Robust Multi-Agent Combinatorial Path Finding".

## Files overview

* FindConflict.py - Implements the conflict detection logic used by the high-level CBS framework. Identifies both standard and delay-based conflicts between agents' paths.
* LowLevelPlan.py - Contains the low-level planner responsible for computing individual agent paths given a set of constraints and a fixed goal sequence allocation.
* NodeStateConstClasses.py - Defines the data structures for representing constraint tree nodes, constraints, and agent states used throughout the planning process.
* Run_pRobustCbss.py - Main entry point for running the pRobustCbss algorithm. Handles initialization, parameter setup, and execution of the full planning pipeline.
* Simulation_for_type2_test.py - A simulation script designed to test the plannerâ€™s performance under specific configurations (Type 2 tests) for robustness evaluation.
* TestVsBaseline1.py - Runs comparative experiments between pRobustCbss and the first baseline method, allowing benchmark analysis and result collection.
* TestVsBaseline2And3.py - Similar to TestVsBaseline1.py, this script compares pRobustCbss with Baseline 2 and Baseline 3, supporting extended benchmarking.
* Verify.py - Provides verification utilities for checking the correctness and robustness of computed solutions, including probabilistic robustness validation.
* createMap.py - Utility script to create and initialize test maps/environments used in simulations, including agent and goal placements.
* kBestSequencing.py - Implements the core logic of the K-Best Sequencing procedure, generating multiple optimal goal sequence allocations by solving the problem as a standard TSP after applying a transformation.
* kBestSequencingWithGLKH.py - A variant of kBestSequencing.py that directly integrates the Generalized Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun (GLKH) solver to solve the problem as an E-GTSP, allowing native handling of clusters and improving accuracy for complex goal structures.
